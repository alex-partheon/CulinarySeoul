# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CulinarySeoul ERP is a React + TypeScript dual-dashboard system designed for multi-brand restaurant management with eventual brand separation capabilities. The system supports both company-wide management and brand-specific operations through a sophisticated hybrid permission system.

**Key Features**:
- **Dual Dashboard Architecture**: Separate company (`/company`) and brand (`/brand`) dashboards
- **Hybrid Permission System**: Users can have access to both company and brand dashboards simultaneously
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organized into company, brand, and store domains
- **Supabase Integration**: Authentication, database, and real-time features
- **Security-First**: Comprehensive permission management and security testing

## Language & Documentation Standards

**Î™®Îì† Î¨∏ÏÑúÎäî ÌïúÍ∏ÄÎ°ú ÏûëÏÑ±ÎêòÍ≥† Í¥ÄÎ¶¨Îê©ÎãàÎã§** (All documentation is written and managed in Korean):

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 19** with **TypeScript**
- **React Router 7** with nested routing for company/brand separation
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: React Router v7 merged `react-router-dom` into `react-router`. Use `import { Link, useLocation } from 'react-router'`
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with **Radix UI** components
  - Using new Tailwind v4 syntax: `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme` directive
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications
- **Domain-Driven Design** structure

### Key Dependencies
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Database and auth client
- `@radix-ui/*` - Accessible UI primitives (avatar, dialog, dropdown-menu, etc.)
- `react-router` v7.7.1 - Routing system (no separate react-router-dom)
- `react-hot-toast` - Toast notifications
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `class-variance-authority` - Component variants
- `tailwind-merge` - Tailwind class merging
- `recharts` - Chart components for analytics

### Vite Configuration
- Path alias configured: `@/` ‚Üí `./src/`
- React plugin for Fast Refresh
- ESM module system

## Authentication & Permissions

### Authentication System
- **Supabase Auth** with email/password
- **AuthContext** for global auth state
- **Hybrid Permission System** supporting both company and brand access
- **Protected Routes** with role-based access

### Permission Architecture
- **UserPermissions**: Defines what dashboards a user can access
- **DashboardSession**: Tracks current dashboard context
- **PermissionService**: Manages permission logic and caching (singleton pattern)
- **PermissionGuard**: Component-level permission checking

## Domain Architecture

### Domain Structure
Each domain follows a consistent pattern:
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `*Service.ts` - Business logic and data access
- `index.ts` - Public API exports

### Current Domains
1. **Company**: Top-level organization management
2. **Brand**: Brand-specific operations (Î∞ÄÎûç etc.)
3. **Store**: Individual store management (ÏÑ±ÏàòÏ†ê etc.)
4. **User**: User and permission management
5. **Inventory**: Stock and product management with FIFO engine
6. **Order**: Order processing and fulfillment
7. **Payments**: Payment integration (Toss Payments)

## Routing System

### Route Structure
- `/` - Root redirect to company dashboard
- `/login` - Authentication page
- `/style-guide` - Component showcase and design system
- `/company/*` - Company dashboard and sub-pages
- `/brand/*` - Brand dashboard and sub-pages
- Protected routes with permission checks

## Task Management

**Ï§ëÏöî**: Tasks are managed in `docs/TASK.md` with detailed 40-week development plan.

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **TASK-001**: Basic architecture and dual dashboard routing
- ‚úÖ **TASK-002**: Hybrid permission system implementation  
- ‚úÖ **TASK-003**: Company-brand-store data model implementation
- üöß **TASK-004**: Company dashboard UI implementation (in progress)

### Task Processing Rules
1. Read current tasks from `docs/TASK.md`
2. Update completion status immediately upon finishing work
3. Mark completed items with ‚úÖ
4. Document implementation changes and notes
5. Update progress in both TASK.md and CLAUDE.md

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Component and service testing with Jest + Testing Library
- **Security Tests**: Permission and access control testing
- **Integration Tests**: Domain service integration
- **Coverage**: Target 90%+ for security-critical code

### Test Configuration
- Jest with TypeScript support via ts-jest
- jsdom environment for React component testing
- CSS modules mocked with identity-obj-proxy

## Development Environment

### Configuration
- **Vite**: Build tool with path aliases (`@/` ‚Üí `./src/`)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **ESLint**: React hooks and refresh plugins
- **PostCSS**: Tailwind CSS v4 processing

### Development Guidelines
- **Korean-First**: All user-facing content in Korean
- **Component-Driven**: Build reusable Radix UI components
- **Security-First**: Test permissions and validate inputs
- **Type-Safe**: Use TypeScript throughout

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Port Conflicts
Development server typically runs on port 5173, but may use 5174+ if occupied. Check terminal output for actual port.

### React Router v7 Migration
If you see "Right side of assignment cannot be destructured" errors:
- Change all imports from `react-router-dom` to `react-router`
- React Router v7 consolidated all exports into the main package

### Tailwind CSS v4
- Uses new import syntax: `@import "tailwindcss"`
- CSS variables defined with `@theme` directive
- Simplified config file (no theme extend needed)

## Security Considerations

- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for data isolation
- **Permission Validation**: Client and server-side permission checks
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with expiration
- **Audit Logging**: Track permission changes and access
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API calls

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
